## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Arnis
### About me
- As a C# programmer, I really appreciate the power of code and its ability to turn interesting ideas into reality. I'm constantly trying to learn new skills and occasionally work on my own little projects. I am happy to be part of a community of programmers who are constantly innovating and developing the field.

### Projects
- SQL: SQL was used to manage and manipulate the relational databases by writing queries to retrieve data, create tables and modify data structures.
- Flight Planner: Web application development using C#, HTTP, Web API and TypeScript. The project used Flight programming API, which required problem solving skills.
- Scooter Rental: Test-driven development was implemented to ensure that every feature was tested and all defects were fixed and resolved early in the development cycle, thus improving the quality of the software.
